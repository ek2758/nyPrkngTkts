Methodical organization of my R and Python code to build and analyze my datasets for my master's thesis

Employing parking ticket data received from the New York City Department of Finance through a FOIL request, this R code goes through the entire process of cleaning, scrubbing, and analyzing this data. This repository is meant to act as a  reference for the future me, my classmates, my professors, and others. I have been using R for a few months, so please do not consider this repository as the most efficient, clean, and best R code you've ever seen. I try, but I may not know.
